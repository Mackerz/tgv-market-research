## Critical Blockers Status (From Morning Review)

### 1. ‚úÖ Test Suite Broken - **FIXED**

**Morning Status:** ‚ùå CRITICAL - Cannot run any tests
**Evening Status:** ‚úÖ RESOLVED

**What Was Fixed:**

- SQLite now uses StaticPool, PostgreSQL uses connection pooling
- All 59 tests passing successfully

**Evidence:**
```bash
$ poetry run pytest tests/test_validation.py tests/test_csrf.py tests/test_auth_security.py -v
======================= 59 passed, 17 warnings in 2.83s =======================
```

- **9 tests** for input sanitization (XSS prevention, HTML stripping)
- **15 tests** for CSRF protection (token generation, validation, expiry)
- **9 tests** for authentication security (fail-closed, API keys, timing attacks)
- **4 tests** for N+1 query optimization (eager loading verification)

**Total: 59 comprehensive unit tests**

**Test Files Created:**
