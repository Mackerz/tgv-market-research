# üö® CRITICAL SECURITY CLEANUP REQUIRED

## Status: ‚úÖ Credential Removed from Git History

The GCP service account key has been **successfully removed** from Git history and is now ignored by `.gitignore`.

However, **CRITICAL STEPS REMAIN** that you must complete manually:

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED (Do This Now!)

### Step 1: Revoke the Compromised Key in GCP Console

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/serviceaccounts
2. Select your project: `tmg-market-research` (or your project ID)
3. Find the service account that owns the key
4. Click on the service account
5. Go to the "KEYS" tab
6. Find the key with ID that matches the file: `tmg-market-research-fd13d009581b.json`
7. Click the three dots menu ‚Üí **Delete**
8. Confirm deletion

### Step 2: Audit for Unauthorized Access

1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/logs
2. Run this query to check for unauthorized access:
   ```
   resource.type="service_account"
   protoPayload.authenticationInfo.principalEmail=~".*tmg-market-research.*"
   timestamp>="2024-10-20T00:00:00Z"
   ```
3. Review any suspicious activity
4. Check for:
   - Unexpected API calls
   - Data downloads
   - Resource creation
   - Permission changes

### Step 3: Generate New Service Account Key

1. In the same service account page (KEYS tab)
2. Click "ADD KEY" ‚Üí "Create new key"
3. Select "JSON" format
4. Click "CREATE"
5. Save the downloaded file to: `/home/mackers/tmg/marketResearch/backend/NEW-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY.json`
6. Update your `.env` file:
   ```bash
   GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=/app/NEW-SERVICE-ACCOUNT-KEY.json
   ```

### Step 4: Update Docker Configuration

Update `backend/Dockerfile` if it references the old key path.

### Step 5: Update Production Secrets

If you've deployed to production:
1. Go to: https://console.cloud.google.com/security/secret-manager
2. Update any secrets that reference the old service account
3. Redeploy your application

### Step 6: Delete the Old Key File Locally

**ONLY AFTER** you've generated a new key and verified everything works:
```bash
rm /home/mackers/tmg/marketResearch/backend/tmg-market-research-fd13d009581b.json
```

## ‚úÖ What's Been Done

- ‚úÖ Removed credential file from Git tracking
- ‚úÖ Removed credential file from entire Git history (all 18 commits)
- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` with comprehensive patterns to prevent future commits:
  - `**/tmg-market-research-*.json`
  - `**/*-service-account-*.json`
  - `**/service-account-key*.json`
  - All `.json` files (except package.json, tsconfig.json)
- ‚úÖ Git garbage collection completed
- ‚úÖ Verified removal from history

---

## üîí .gitignore Protection Added

The following patterns now prevent credential commits:

```gitignore
# GCP credentials - NEVER COMMIT THESE
**/tmg-market-research-*.json
**/*-service-account-*.json
**/service-account-key*.json
*.json
!package*.json
!tsconfig*.json
!**/alembic.ini
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

### If You've Already Pushed to Remote Repository:

If this repository has been pushed to GitHub/GitLab/etc:

1. **Force push** to update remote history:
   ```bash
   git push origin --force --all
   ```

2. **Notify all collaborators** to:
   - Delete their local clones
   - Re-clone the repository fresh
   - **DO NOT** push from old clones (will restore the compromised key)

3. **Consider making the repository private** if it's currently public

### If This Was a Public Repository:

1. **Assume the key is compromised** - it may have been scraped by bots
2. **Rotate ALL credentials** that the service account had access to
3. **Review all GCP resources** for unauthorized changes
4. **Consider security incident reporting** if required by your organization

## üìã Verification Checklist

- [ ] Old service account key revoked in GCP Console
- [ ] Audit logs reviewed for suspicious activity
- [ ] New service account key generated
- [ ] `.env` file updated with new key path
- [ ] Application tested with new key
- [ ] Old key file deleted from local machine
- [ ] Remote repository force-pushed (if applicable)
- [ ] Team notified (if applicable)
- [ ] Production secrets updated (if applicable)

## üìû Need Help?

If you encounter issues:
1. Check GCP Console error logs
2. Verify new key has required permissions
3. Ensure `.env` file path is correct
4. Test GCP connectivity: `gcloud auth application-default print-access-token`
